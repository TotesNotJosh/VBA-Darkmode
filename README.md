# VBA-Darkmode
Adds a darkmode to your excel sheets using VBA. This will iterate through all sheets and update them.
## Installation
Create a new module and put the top section in that. If you have UserForms put the middle section in their code. If you want to prevent accidentally using all of your ink each time you print add the bottom section to ThisWorkbook.
